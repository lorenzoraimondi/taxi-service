# taxi-service
myTaxiService is an application aimed to satisfy citizens' taxi requests. The system helps users to call a taxi on a desired time and location, and helps taxi driver to get a more sharp and suited service. The application can be accessed either via a web browser or with a mobile application compatible with most common mobile OSs, and requires a registration in order to use the service. Users can book a taxi in a specific location, either for an immediate request or for a reservation booking. Taxi drivers instead are disposed in queues, relative to a certain city zone; the queue allows to gain an order of drivers so that the system can forward a request with a fair and smart management. All the communications about useful informations like requests, response, time, are forwarded from and to the users by a notifcation system.
